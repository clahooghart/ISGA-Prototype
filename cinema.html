                Pathé runs four big cinema complexes
                in Amsterdam–the most impressive being the Pathé Arena in
                Bijlmer–which also boasts an imax
                theatre and shows movies on a huge
                screen. Pathé Tuschinski is situated
                in a magnificent Art Deco building in
                the city centre. A lot of Dutch movies
                have also been filmed in this building. Pathé cinemas mostly screen
                Hollywood blockbusters, plus some
                art-house movies (pac), and Turkish
                and Bollywood movies. On Tuesday
                evenings, Pathé offers special sneak
                previews. If you show your student
                card, you can get a discounted ticket.

                This place is more than just a cinema.

                The focus is on showing movies from
